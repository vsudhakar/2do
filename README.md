A work in progress collaboration tool between multiple people based on Firebase syncing &amp; Bootstrap 3.

What is done so far:

- Creating a group name in Firebase
- Creating a user directoy & inserting user
- Creating tasks in Firebase & displaying on screen

What needs to be done:

- Fixing the user creation (only create if group does not exist -> currently creates by default instead of opening)
- Feature to delete tasks
- Feature to view other members in group
- Feature to add certain members to certain tasks
- Notes for tasks
- Ability to see who completed which tasks
- Goal completion bar (progress bar with increases based on task completion) / Scoring system (gamification)
- Bitly link shortening to share with collaboraters (maybe with GET in link)
- Bootstrap "badge" creation function for users
